#The deployment.yaml file provided here in this folder can be used to deploy a zookeeper-client in POD.
#Scenario:
>We may have setup kafka cluster using our own images/ images from web/ using HELM charts etc.
>This cluster would be running on EKS in different PODS > containers across worker nodes.
>We can get into one of zookeeper pods and work with zookeeper client (zkCli) OR
>We can have a 'zookeeper-client' image running within a container within a POD which allows us to connect to zookeeper

#to use this deployment.yaml we need to 
$kubectl apply -f zookeeper-client/deployment.yaml

#After pod is running , connect to pod and test access
